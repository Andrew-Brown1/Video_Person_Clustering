# Video Person Clustering
Repo for the Video Person Clustering dataset, and code for the associated paper. This reporsitory contains the Video Person Clustering Dataset (below), and the code (coming soon...) from the associated paper, for the task of video person-clustering

## Video Person Clustering Dataset (VPCD)

The dataset can be downloaded from this link. The tar.gz file contains the dataset, and a README detailing the contents

VPCD is built upon popular video datasets that are commonly used in the Computer Vision community (e.g. [TBBT](http://tvd.niderb.fr/assets/pdf/lrec2014.pdf), [Buffy](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/everingham06a.pdf), [Friends](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/c1c/src/VickyKalogeitonBMVC2020.pdf), [Sherlock](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2017/Nagrani17b/nagrani17b.pdf), [About Last Night](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11289.pdf), [Hidden Figures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11289.pdf)) 

## Code
